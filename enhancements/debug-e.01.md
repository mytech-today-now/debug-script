enhancement:

in 'debug-script\debug-2.php' refactor the tabs so that the active tab is left aligned with the content of the page, and the tabs area collapses to one row, and hides the other tabs.  When the user hovers over the active tab or the tab's row space, then all of the tabs re-order into appearance, using animation, to go into the space and layout that are currently in in the pre-refactored stated.
